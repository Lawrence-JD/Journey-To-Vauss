In my testing folder are all my files.
I left comments :
right before the main game loop in main.py,
towards the bottom of the create_attributes funtion in Map02.py,
and towards the bottom of the tilecheck function in Map02.py
explaining my current issues in fairly decent detail. 

I'm going to take a break today. I've been screwing with it for 3 hours today and most of yesterday and it'd be a
healthy time for a break.
If you have an suggestions after running it or whatsoever then message me on discord.
Otherwise I'll mess with it again later tonight, around 10 or so.

P.S
Just so no one is confused, transportation.txt is just a testing map for transportation. The tile number for that purple orb (421) is what I'm using for transportation as of
right now.
